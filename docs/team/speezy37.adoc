== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *scheduling system.*
** What it does: This allows all users to have a unique schedule to be updated on where and when to work for the day.
** Justification: This feature is a core component of the product as certain functions (such as leave application),
require user authentication. Both command can be executed by any user to view and set their own schedule.
However, a user with priority level of `ADMINISTRATOR` is needed to view and set schedule for others.
** Highlights: This is the only variable within a `Person` object that is more OOP oriented as `Schedule` is an object
that contains 3 variables: `TimeStart`, `TimeEnd` and `Venue`. When a `Person` object is first created, the `Schedule`
object can be null if not defined. Calling the `toString()` method will return either the details of the `Schedule` in
string format or the `nullPointerException` will return `'No schedule is allocated'`.
