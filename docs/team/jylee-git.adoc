== PROJECT: Bank Address Book

---

== Overview

Bank Address Book (BankAB) is a business process management and workflow application platform, whereby its users are
all the employees in a banking environment.
This platform supports the basic daily routine of each employee such as:

*  Checking working schedule
*  Applying for leave application
*  Checking in and out during working hours

The managers and administrators will have higher priority access level of BankAB such as changing the
priority level of the employee and approve or reject leave requests.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: implemented *user account with corresponding APIs and commands.*
** What it does: This allows all users to have a unique account to login and perform functions that are essential for
 work purpose.
** Justification: This feature is a core component of the product as certain functions (such as leave application),
require user authentication.
** Highlights: This enhancement is challenging as we need to modify a major portion of existing source codes and test
 codes, owing to the fact that the newly added NRIC parameter is unique and other existing fields, which are initially
 unique, are now not. In addition, many functions that are developed by my team is dependent on this feature. This
 results in the pressure on me to deliver this feature at the shortest time possible.

 * *Major enhancement 2*: implemented *priority access level with corresponding APIs and commands.*
 ** What it does: All user accounts will have a priority level, which will allow/restrict them to functions that
 require an elevated user to do so.
 ** Justification: This feature is also a core component and complements the implementation of user accounts, as some
  features (e.g.: Approving of leaves), require someone of a senior rank to do so. This will prevent users from
  potentially abusing company resources and product functions.
