== PROJECT: Bank Address Book

---

== Overview

Bank Address Book (BankAB) is a business process management and workflow application platform, whereby its users are
all the employees in a banking environment.
This platform supports the basic daily routine of each employee such as:

*  Checking working schedule
*  Applying for leave application
*  Checking in and out during working hours

The managers and administrators will have higher priority access level of BankAB such as changing the
priority level of the employee and approve or reject leave requests.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement* : added *leave application function* for employees.
** What it does: Allows the user to request leave application. This leave application is subjected for approval from their boss. Only a higher level priority user can approve/ reject or delete a low priority user's leave application. Also, it allows the user to filter or list all existing leave applications in the system.
** Justification: This feature is a core component to the product as it gives users the capability to request/ approve/ reject/ delete leave application in the system easily.
** Highlights:  The implementation requires new classes and commands to be created and also affects current existing `delete` and `setplvl` commands.
The implementation was challenging due to the different privileges each priority level have which affects commands such as `approve`, `reject` and `deleteleave`.

* *Minor enhancement*: UI changes such as color theme changes, removal of browser panel, addition of leave application tab and image view.
